# Ethereum wallet generator from private keys stored at excel file

1. That python code calculates Ethereum wallet addresses from Private Keys. Private keys and they are stored on a excel file and output will be stored on the same excel file.
2. We use the ```ethereum``` library in Python along with the ```pandas``` library for reading the private keys from an Excel file. Make sure you have these libraries installed before running the code
4. Before running the code, make sure to place the Excel file ```private_keys.xlsx``` in the same directory as the Python script. Adjust the sheet name and column header as per your specific Excel file structure.
5. The code reads the private keys from the Excel file, generates the corresponding Ethereum wallet addresses, and then prints them to the console. You can modify the code to store the addresses in a separate file or use them for further processing as needed.
